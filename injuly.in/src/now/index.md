# June, 2025

*previous entry: [Feb 2025](/now/feb-2025/)*

Four months since anyone said a word on this site.
I've since switched jobs to work on a fledgling startup,
which leaves me very little time to write.
Given how long its been, I might as well call this the "Then" page.

Nevertheless, here's (some of) what I've been up to:
- Toying with [hasktorch](http://hasktorch.org/).
- Learning Computational Geometry and NURBS modeling.
- Reading Ben Rich's [Skunkworks Memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101438.Skunk_Works).
- Playing WC3, if I can make the time for it.

Progress on [Jam](https://github.com/srijan-paul/jam) has crawled to a halt,
and my new job leaves me with no time to cater to it.
Even in its current state, Jam is an _extremely_ fast JS parser + semantic analyzer. 
I don't know I'll be able to deliver on [my initial plan](/blog/announcing-jam/) anymore,
but I have every intention of packaging it up as a library for anyone who needs to process JavaScript code.
