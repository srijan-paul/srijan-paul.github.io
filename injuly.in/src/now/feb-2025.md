# February, 2025

*previous entry: [October 2024](/now/oct-2024/)*

I have been more occupied than usual these past few months, so here's 
another short entry until next time:

I've been making slow progress on [Jam](https://codeberg.org/injuly/jam) â€“ my JS toolchain,
and keeping up with computer graphics on the side whenever I can find the time.

Currently reading [A Quiet Life in the Country](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30178957-a-quiet-life-in-the-country),
and playing [Lies of P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_of_P).
