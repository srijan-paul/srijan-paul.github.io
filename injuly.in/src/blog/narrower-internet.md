How often do you append "reddit" or "wiki" to your Google search queries? <br>
After half a century of tech advancements, you would expect the internet to have become more explorable, obscure but relevant pages easier to find, and
public discourse more readily accessible;
but things seem to have gone in the opposite direction.

If you asked Google for a workout routine a decade ago, you would get a workout routine.
If you ask Google for a workout routine today, you'll get: paid search results, ads, third party cookies, trackers, newsletter prompts, location/notification requests, more ads, and, if you're lucky â€“ a workout routine[^1].

No matter what you search for, SEO hacked content farms will blot out the sun.
