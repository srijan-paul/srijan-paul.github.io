Do you often append "reddit" or "wiki" to your Google search queries? <br>
Seek out human discourse on specific websites, 
when search engines were invented to do it for you?

If you asked Google for a movie review in 2005, you'd get a review.
Ask Google today, and you get paid search results, ads, third party cookies,
trackers, newsletter prompts, notification access requests, and,
if you're lucky – a movie review.
No matter what you search for, SEO hacked content farms will blot out the sun.[^1]

Today, the average article is written not to be read, but to be found—by a search engine,
that is—so it can monetize every fibre of your eyeballs.
Keep you reading, scrolling, clicking, and sharing.

It's free! (Just enter your email ;)).

There was a time when this wasn't as rampant –
when sites run by individuals were easier to find,
and communities developed organically across multiple forums.
game mods and fanfics weren't subreddits; and personal websites didn't live on substack or medium.[^2]

While content farms squabble over, everything has moved to select few apps:
videos on YouTube, images on Instagram, and discussions on Reddit.
The internet grows in volume, but shrinks in diversity.

But you know what's worse than SEO spam?
AI generated SEO spam.

Today, there are services that [generate thousands of articles](/assets/img/darker-internet/seo-heist.webp),
post them on multiple platforms,
then create fake social media profiles to market them.
The phrase "As an AI language model" now turns up on social media platforms,
amazon, Yelp, and even Google scholar.
In a matter of weeks, LLMs can generate more text than has ever been written in human history.

## Footnotes

[^1]: This is by design, Of course. A search engine cannot make money by nimbly leading you to webpages free of charge. The real money is in *hiding*  pages. Showing only the results from firms that can pay to retain their position in the results page – either by paying Google directly, or by hosting ads that share revenue with Google.
[^2]: That is not to say blogs on substack or medium are inferior. Some of my favourite blogs are on substack. Only that reading everyone's blogs on the same few platforms doesn't feel as diverse.
