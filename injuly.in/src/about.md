## Me 

A CS and math enthusiast put up in Bangalore, India. <br>
I'm a programmer by trade, and work at [DeepSource](https://deepsource.com) – a code health monitoring platform.

As of 2024, My interests lie in:

- **Programming**: Compilers, computer networks, databases, FP.
- **Reading**: High fantasy, golden age Japanese mystery, sci-fi.
- **Math**: Category theory, linear algebra.
- **Technology**: Retro console architecture (NES, Game Boy, PlayStation), game development.
- **Miscellaneous**: Pixel art, typography.

I don't actively play as many video games anymore,
but have grown up playing Warcraft 3, DotA 2, and Nuclear Throne – in that order.

To see what I'm up to *right now*, check the [now page](/now). <br>
To start a conversation, just [hit me up](#contact).
