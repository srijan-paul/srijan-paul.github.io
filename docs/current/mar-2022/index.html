		<h2 id="march-2022">March 2022</h2>
<p>At the time of me writing this, march is nearly over.
I can't say the past 3 months have been the most productive,
but atleast the trajectory isn't too bad.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Finished since last update:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read">Purescript by example</a>: <em>Chef's kiss</em>.
I didn't read it cover-to-cover, because it's repetitive for anyone familiar with Haskell.
I still found myself binging it in 3 days.
This book explains not just purescript, but fundamental functional programming concepts
that a programmer can apply everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492285-dune-messiah">Dune Messiah</a>:
The first two acts were &quot;okay&quot;, the final act was fantastic and hearbreaking.
The ending is memorable, and probably one my favorite climaxes in any book despite being rushed.
My only gripe is with the frequent and long philosophical paragraphs that steer my attention away from the plot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian">The Martian</a>:
A good read.
The scientific accuracy of everything stood out the most to me.
It can get very monotonous at times.
Most of the book is just journal entries from the protagonist.
Perhaps my review is skewed towards the lower end because
I read it in several sittings, interspersed with long gaps and other misc. reading material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59795331-do-epic-shit">Do epic shit</a>:
I just could not bring myself to like this book.
I'm not an avid reader of the self-help genre, but a friend had gifted this to me earlier this year.
I finally got around to reading it, and was very hopeful owing to the social media hype this has spawned.
However I don't deem it worth all the praise it's been getting.
At its best, it's a series of disconnected but temporarily inspiring scrawls.
At its worst, it's a &quot;JUST-DO-IT&quot; twitter thread printed on paper.</p>

<p>Currently reading:</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p><a href="https://injuly.in/vyse">Vyse</a> Now supports loading modules,
and has a more fleshed out standard lirbary.
It's time I take a step back and add documentation for the standard library and embedding API.</p>
<p>I'm likely to start a pet project in the next month.
Although I won't commit to it in form of writing before I'm <em>really</em> sure I'm going to do it.
So I guess we'll have to wait before it's &quot;announced&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>I <em>have</em> to start keeping track of the research papers I half-read and then forget.
I recently finished reading <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf">this</a> paper by Graham Hutton,
A haskell version of all the code presented in the paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/Monparsing-paper/blob/main/MonParse.hs">here</a>.
I'm planning on writing about it in the next week.</p>
<p>The frequency of posts on my blog has been lower than what I promised myself, but I hope this
results in higher quality posts than usual.</p>
