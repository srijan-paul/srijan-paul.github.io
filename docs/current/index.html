<p>This month, I was busy setting base in Bangalore.
Moving is a lot of work, and I'm taking my time getting used to the city - loads of people,
incessant honking on roads, metros operating at twice their capacity, and a language foreign to me.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a lot more that will be to my liking, and I'm just taking my time getting used to it.
The whole moving-and-packing dance, however, disrupted my usual schedule
(which wasn't something to be proud of in the first place).
I'm a little behind on some personal projects, and there's no library here like there was back in college,
but my trajectory will fix itself.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Still on Words of Radiance, and I picked <a href="https://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real world haskell</a> back up.</p>
<p>My to-read list looks almost the same as last time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/bootstrapping-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-and-terraform">Bootstrapping Microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform</a>

<p>In a span of about 2 days, I made something cool - a Brainfuck interpreter, written entirely in TypeScript's type-system.
The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/tsfun/blob/main/src/index.ts">here on GitHub</a>.
I also spoke about it in a talk about type-level programming and turing complete type systems.
[TODO@self: add a link here once it's uploaded to YouTube].</p>
<p>Last time, I said I'll be writing an Neural Language Model.
Well, I changed my mind.</p>
<p>Lately, I've been looking into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a>'s architecture.
I want to write an emulator for it, but my current understanding of its hardware (and 6502 assembly) is far from adequate.</p>
<p>Everyday, after coming home from work, I've been making notes, and reading the <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki">NESDev wiki</a>.
Perhaps I'll have something to show in my next log?</p>
<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research the NES's hardware, and the 6502 assembly language.
</li>
<li>Organize some papers and further reading for LLMs in my private notion, for later use.
Look into some keyboards to replace my current one.
</li>
</ul>
