<p>I was supposed to write this update in April, but ended up falling sick in the last week.
Tied to my bed no longer, I will spend the month of May writing Zig libraries, and mentoring in Google Summer of Code.</p>
<h2 id="making-oss-screen-capture-tools">Making OSS screen capture tools</h2>
<p>Last month, I was hacking on a screen-capture library in Zig
<sup>(<a href="/blog/screen-capture">post</a>)</sup>.
I ran some experiments trying to take screenshots and record my screen, then encoding the captured frames into GIFs.</p>
<p>Since then, I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented a screenshot app with Rust, Tauri, and SolidJS.
</li>
<li>Profiled the app and realized JS is the wrong choice for &quot;native&quot; apps.
</li>
<li>Ditched JavaScript frameworks and re-wrote the whole thing in C++.
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, the latest build of <em><strong>blink</strong></em>—a nimble screenshot app—now consumes 10x less memory, and is much snappier.</p>
<p>Down the road, I plan to add GIF and WebP support as well.
For this, I&#39;ve been exploring quantization and dithering techniques to get the best out of the dated GIF format (This research may or may not result in a blog post).</p>
<h2 id="mentoring-in-google-summer-of-code">Mentoring in Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~hgualandi/">Hugo</a>—erm, <em>Professor</em> Hugo (congratulations!)—emailed me about GSoC.
I&#39;m more than happy to help students get into OSS research, and will thus be mentoring contributors to <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">the Pallene compiler</a>.</p>
<p>Pallene is a research project that compiles a typed dialect of Lua down to native code.
It&#39;s hero feature is Lua interop:
libraries written in Pallene, which are usually much faster, can be directly imported into Lua programs.</p>
<p>In 2021, I too was a student developer working on Pallene.
I dug up <a href="blog/gsoc/">my report</a> on this blog from three years ago, and despite the rusty writing, it was a fun read.</p>
