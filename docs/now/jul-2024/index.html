<p><em>previous entry: <a href="/now/may-2024">May 2024</a></em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been making decent progress on some of my hobby projects,
and taking care not to burn out in the process.</p>
<p>To cope with my growing backlog,
I&#39;ve become comfortable with this idea of managing a stack of on-going projects.
I maintain a pile of three projects that are &quot;active&quot;.
At any given time, I can only be working on one of these.
When work gets too mundane, or if I feel I&#39;m risking burnout,
I put the project back in the pile and draw another one.
The pile must not grow – I get to add a new project <em>only</em> when an active
one is finished.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the two projects I last drew from the pile:</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="nez--nes-emulator"><a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/nez">nez</a> – NES Emulator</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/jul-2024/fceux_nez_comparison_1200.png" alt="FCEUX (top) and nez (bottom)"></img></p>
<p>Nez can now run games like Final Fantasy 2, Journey to Silius, and Robocop 3.
The emulator is also more accurate than before,
passing more PPU test ROMs than <a href="https://fceux.com/web/home.html">FCEUX</a>, as pictured above.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;m working on emulating the APU to finally have some audio.
This turned out to be much harder than I expected, but it wouldn&#39;t be so rewarding if it wasn&#39;t hard.</p>
<p>As fun as this project is, I wish the Famicom had a more diverse game library.
Most games simply don&#39;t hold up well today, though there are some notable exceptions to this.
To challenge myself some more, I wish to try my hand at a Game Boy Advance
or PlayStation emulator sometime.
Maybe then I&#39;ll have a virtual console that I&#39;ll enjoy using myself :)</p>
<h3 id="frametap--screen-capture-library-with-gif-support">Frametap – Screen capture library with GIF support</h3>
<p>The screen capture library hasn&#39;t seen as much progress as I had hoped for.
I&#39;ve managed to cobble together a CLI tool that can quantize PNG images and record a GIF
from any region of the screen.
Some problems still remain – like large GIF sizes and flickering colors.</p>
<p>When I get back to it, I&#39;ll be adding WebP support, along with the ability to record on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<h3 id="sniper--language-agnostic-call-stack-analysis">Sniper – Language agnostic call stack analysis</h3>
<p>I usually don&#39;t write about my full time job here.
This is a <em>personal</em> website, and I like to think that my personhood goes beyond a payslip,
but that doesn&#39;t mean my job is boring.
This past week, <a href="https://tushar.lol">Tushar</a> and I have been hacking on a language agnostic call stack analyzer.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: for any codebase, it generates a graph of all function calls made inside an expression.
As an example, take this little program:</p>
<code class="language-py"><div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode"><span id="1"><a href="#1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> gcd(a, b):</span>
<span id="2"><a href="#2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">return</span> a <span class="cf">if</span> b <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="cf">else</span> gcd_helper(a, b)</span>
<span id="3"><a href="#3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="4"><a href="#4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> gcd_helper(a, b):</span>
<span id="5"><a href="#5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="cf">return</span> gcd(b, a <span class="op">%</span> b)</span>
<span id="6"><a href="#6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="7"><a href="#7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> main():</span>
<span id="8"><a href="#8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  gcd(<span class="dv">48</span>, <span class="dv">18</span>)</span>
<span id="9"><a href="#9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="10"><a href="#10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># perform stack analysis for this call expression</span></span>
<span id="11"><a href="#11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main()</span></code></pre></div></code></pre>
<p>For this Python snippet, the analyzer emits a graph like this:</p>

<p>Not so impressive when you run it for a trivial program,
but this tool proves to be very useful when scanning vulnerable code.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>I recently bought a Switch, and have been enjoying my time playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild">Breath of the Wild</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcooked">Overcooked</a>.
As for reading, I&#39;m currently working my way through <a href="https://danfesperman.com/novels/safe-houses/">Safe Houses</a>.</p>
<p>Until next time o/</p>
