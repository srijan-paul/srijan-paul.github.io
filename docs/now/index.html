<p>Happy New Year!
Its 2024, and I want to test the limits of my ability with challenging projects.
Here&#39;s a few things that I want to try before the year is out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jonas_Vinther_demonstrating_the_five_faces_of_Sybil.gif">Five faces of sybil</a>
</li>
<li>A(nother) programming language with a powerful hindley-milner type system, ADTs, typeclasses, pattern matching, etc.
</li>
<li>Text editor with modal editing and LSP support.
<ul>
<li>Bonus: Collaborative editing.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3D renderer on the terminal.
</li>
<li>GUI client for working with SQLite databases.
</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve implemented background rendering in the <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU">PPU</a>, and it can now draw Donkey Kong&#39;s background (with some glitches).
For reasons unknown to me, the attribute table reads aren&#39;t accurate right now.
And if you couldn&#39;t tell already, there are no foreground sprites.</p>
<p>Currently, it cannot run games that rely on background scrolling features in the hardware, and require more complex mapper circuits.
I&#39;ll have a playable version of Donkey Kong before moving on to more complex games.</p>
<h3 id="plans-for-this-website">Plans for this website</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve always wanted my websites to be as lean as possible.
Think lightweight pages, view-source-able markup,
no fancy animations or loaders, no cookies or trackers,
and no JavaScript in places where it can be avoided.
Last year, I moved away from <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>, and added support for build-time syntax highlighting in my static site generator.
This helped shed about 38kB of JS and CSS from every page that had code snippets in it.</p>
<p>However, I still bundle JS with some pages on this website.
For instance: the list of posts in <a href="/blog">/blog</a> and <code>/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</code> is generated using a script tag
that uses some metadata to figure out the the HTML that should be rendered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CSS - although small - is not minified.</p>
<p>Both of these issues exist because of limitations in my static site generator.
Moving forward, I want to make my SSG more general purpose.
It will be available as a binary, and as a library.
Binary for simple websites that need basic text, templating, and hypermedia.
Library for websites that need more powerful build time features.</p>
