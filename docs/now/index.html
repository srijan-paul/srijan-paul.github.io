<p><em>previous entry: <a href="/now/feb-2024">February 27, 2024</a></em></p>
<p>During the covid lockdown, I was developing an RPG game.
Back then, I used to code on a windows machine,
and would often share gameplay GIFs on discord servers.
For this, I would use a nifty app called ScreenToGif.
That was four years ago.
Eventually, the lockdown passed.
I abandoned my project, graduated college,
got a job, moved cities, switched to a MacBook,
and wrote an NES emulator.
Once again, I wanted to share GIFs of my progress on the project.</p>
<p>I reached for the same tool I&#39;d used years ago.
ScreenToGif – a GIF recorder with an integrated editor (yay!)... <em>for windows</em>.
Bummer.
I ended up recording videos with MacOS&#39;s native recorder, then converting them into GIFs with an online tool.</p>
<p>This wasn&#39;t the first time I had to jump through hoops to share a screengrab.
<a href="https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html">LightShot</a>—another app I&#39;d used to capture and edit screenshots—is not available on Linux.
<a href="https://getgreenshot.org/">GreenShot</a> doesn&#39;t support MacOS, and <a href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> <em>only</em> supports MacOS.
I like using them. But why do I know how to use <em>four</em> different apps to take screenshots!?</p>
<p>Why aren&#39;t there any decent cross platform screen capture apps?
Not OBS Studio or ShareX,
just something small that lets me make a PNG, GIF or WebP from my screen;
and perhaps let me edit the resulting media.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are some hurdles that make OS agnostic screen-capture annoying to deal with for an app developer, but nothing that can&#39;t be overcome with a little grunt work.
Humans can send cars to space.
Surely <em>this</em> shouldn&#39;t be too hard?</p>
<p>Only one way to find out.</p>
<h2 id="meet-frametap">Meet Frametap</h2>
<p>As of this month, I&#39;m working on <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/frametap/">frametap</a>:
A cross platform screen capture library in Zig.
My hope is for Frametap to be the underpinning for a no-nonsense screen grabber.
Features on the roadmap are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Raw <strong>RGBA frame capture</strong> – in progress, works on MacOS.
</li>
<li><strong>PNG</strong> encoding – implemented using lodepng.
</li>
<li><strong>GIF</strong> encoding – in progress, uses CGIF.
</li>
<li><strong>WEBP</strong> encoding – planned.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once satisfied with the MVP, I&#39;ll attempt making a screengrab tool that hopefully just works.</p>
