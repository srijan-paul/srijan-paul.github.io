		<h2 id="jan-2022">Jan. 2022</h2>
<p>Whiling away my 5th semester in home isolation with a laptop and a couple of books.
As of January 2021, these are my going ons :^)</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>My current readings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah">Dune - Messiah</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian">The Martian</a>.
I plan on finishing the dune saga in the first half of this year, before I begin some of Sanderson&#39;s books.</p>
<p>I also wish to read  <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com/">Thinking with Types</a> and
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/33618151-category-theory-for-programmers">Category theory for programmers</a>
in the very near future.
The former might be on my desk before the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>I am currently building my static site generator - <a href="https://injuly.in/bark/">Bark</a>. <br />
I&#39;ve recently ported this website to the said SSG, and have added support for tags.
This month I plan on updating the frontmatter parser to a monadic one, implementing directory watching and the ability to serve files on localhost.</p>
<p>Two of my older projects have been dormant for a while -
<a href="https://injuly.in/vyse">Vyse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cpp-gamedev/wex">Wex</a>. <br />
It&#39;s about time I revive them.
For Vyse, I plan to add support for userdata objects and module loading.
A clearer roadmap for wex is yet to come.</p>
<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>This year I plan on doing more game jams on itch, learning more Russian,
playing the Piano and writing at least once every month on the blog.</p>
