      <p>Functional languages are assumed to be inferior at tackling problems
that are best solved with dynamic programming.
This belief is largely based on the absence of state and mutation from pure languages.
It is true that DP often requires a global state (the memoization table),
and continuous updates to the said state.</p>
<p>With lazy evaluation, however, a declarative solution's elegance far supersedes its imperative counterparts.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
approach to any problem involves finding solutions to smaller sub-problems
of similar nature, and then combining them to obtain the answer.</p>
<p>Consider the Fibonacci sequence for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 2
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Most imperative solutions to computing the Nth Fibonacci number would
involve a table of some sort, where each number <code>i</code> is mapped to <code>Fib_i</code>.
The first two items in the table are set to 0 and 1 (or 1 and 2), and the
program then iterates over the size of the table, setting <code>fib[i]</code> to <code>fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]</code>.
One such solution is discussed
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/fibonacci-top-down-vs-bottom-up-dynamic-programming">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-euler-2">Project Euler #2</h2>
<p>This is the question posed in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">problem 2</a>
of the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler archive</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">A new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two.
Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms
</code></pre>
<p>Over the remainder of this post, we'll go over two solutions to this challenge -
an obvious solution using python, and a slightly more elegant approach in Haskell.</p>
<p>The goal is to understand lazy evaluation and functional DP.
Prior knowledge of Haskell will help, but isn't necessary.</p>
<h2 id="imperative-solution">Imperative solution</h2>
<p>There is not much to go over with this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def sum_even_fibs_below(n: int) -&gt; int:
    fibs_cache = list(range(1, 40))
    for i in range(3, len(fibs_cache)):
       fibs_cache[i] = fibs_cache[i - 1] + fibs_cache[i - 2]
    sieve = lambda x: x % 2 == 0 and x &lt; n
    return sum(filter(sieve, fibs_cache))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(sum_even_fibs_below(4000000))
</code></pre>
<p>First, we have <code>fibs_cache</code> - a standard DP table that we update in <code>O(n)</code> time.
Then we filter out entries that are even (or larger than 4M),
and sum over the list.</p>
<p>Mark the presence of a &quot;state&quot; object in the python program -
namely, the <code>fibs_cache</code> list.
We update the items in this cache within a loop.</p>
<p>The rest of the operations in the code are stateless and referentially transparent.
To implement memoization, we're going to leverage two features of Haskell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lazy evaluation.
</li>
<li>Infinite lists.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The second is really just a natural consequence of the first.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-evaluation">Lazy evaluation</h2>
<p>Haskell is a lazily evaluated language, wherein no value is evaluated until it's needed.
To understand what this means, consider the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">let a = get_a () -- takes 1 seconds to compute
    b = get_b () -- takes 2 seconds to compute
    c = get_c () -- takes 3 seconds to compute
in print (a + b)-- takes 1 + 2 = 3 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>When we call <code>print</code>, the expression <code>a + b</code> <em>must</em> be evaluated so that it can be written to stdout.
Before the runtime encounters the call to <code>print</code>, however, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> remain &quot;frozen&quot;.</p>
<p>Since we made the assumption that <code>get_a</code> and <code>get_b</code> require 1 and 2 seconds
to compute, <code>a + b</code> will block the thread for a total of 3 seconds, whereas <code>get_c</code> will never be visited.</p>
<p>Here we notice Haskell's ability to leave chunks of code unevaluated until necessary.
This will turn out to be our cornerstone in tackling dynamic programming problems
with a functional arsenal.</p>
<h3 id="infinite-lists">Infinite lists</h3>
<p>Lazy evaluation enables a neat trick - infinite lists.
Fire up the <code>ghci</code> REPL and enter the following expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">Prelude&gt; [1, 2, ..]
</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the REPL infinitely prints contents of this list until halted.
If you bind to a variable, however, the REPL won't evaluate it right away:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">Prelude&gt; xs = [1, 2 ..]
</code></pre>
<p>We can use <code>xs</code> like a regular linked list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">Prelude&gt; xs !! 4
5
Prelude&gt; takeWhile (&lt; 5) xs
[1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>
<p>To understand the &quot;laziness&quot; better, let's strip away the syntactic sugar.
Without list comprehensions, we can write <code>xs</code> this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">xs :: [Int]
xs = 1 : next xs
  where
    next (x : rest) = (x + 1) : next rest
    next [] = []
</code></pre>
<p>We tell Haskell that <code>xs</code> is a linked list where the first item is <code>1</code>,
and the rest of the items are given by the function call: <code>next xs</code>.
Since Haskell is lazy, it won't make the effort to actually evaluate <code>next xs</code>.
This self reference of <code>xs</code> is therefore considered safe.</p>
<p>However, when we ask for the <code>nth</code> element in <code>xs</code>, the runtime will start
iterating over the list, evaluating the values and chasing pointers until it
reaches the desired slot.</p>
<p>Visually, an infinite list can be thought of as a linked list where the head is some value,
and the body is a &quot;frozen&quot; computation which returns the rest of the list upon thawing.
Calling <code>tail xs</code> will take a step forward and return <code>2 -&gt; [ ... ]</code>.
Calling <code>tail $ tail xs</code> will take 2 steps forward, and return <code>3 -&gt; [...]</code>.</p>
<p>To get comfortable, try working this out on paper.</p>
<h2 id="an-infinite-list-in-python">An infinite list in Python</h2>
<p>Python is not lazy, but we can emulate infinite lists with some effort.
This is purely to build an intuition for the subject, and is not idiomatic Python code.</p>
<p>We start by defining <code>make_list</code> - a function that returns an infinite list.
Later, we're going to define <code>rest</code> and <code>index_list</code>, to mirror Haskell's <code>tail</code> and <code>(!!)</code> functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def make_list(first_item):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Create an infinite list where every item
    is greater than the last by 1 
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    xs = [lambda: first_item]
    xs.append(rest(xs))
    return xs
</code></pre>
<p>To get around the lack of self-references in the language,
we exploit the fact that non-primitives are stored by reference.
i.e - The second element of <code>xs</code> can store a reference to <code>xs</code>.</p>
<p>Every element in <code>xs</code> is a function.
This is to prevent the interpreter from eagerly evaluating the values returned by the function.
The first element is simply the head of the list, and
the second element is a function that, when called, returns the body of <code>xs</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we define <code>rest</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def rest(xs):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Returns the body of a linked list, minus the head.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return lambda: [lambda: xs[0]() + 1, rest(xs[1])]
</code></pre>
<p>It looks gnarly at first, but becomes easier to grasp once you realize that we're really
just using <code>lambda</code> to &quot;freeze&quot; a value. The interpreter won't evaluate a frozen value
unless we &quot;thaw&quot; it using the call operator - <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>At any given moment, our list always contains two items:</p>
<ol>
<li>A &quot;frozen&quot; head.
</li>
<li>A &quot;frozen&quot; body, containing an unevaluated recursive call to <code>rest</code>.
This will again return a 2-element list of the same shape.
</li>
</ol>
<p>You could imagine the function <code>rest</code> as a taking a step forward in our linked-list:</p>
<pre><code>rest [1, &lt;...&gt;] = [2, &lt;...&gt;]
rest [2, &lt;...&gt;] = [3, &lt;...&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we define two simple helpers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def head(xs):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the head of an infinite list&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return xs[0]()

def index_list(xs, i):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Get the ith item in an infinite list
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    curr = xs
    for _ in range(i):
        curr = rest(curr)()
    return head(curr)
</code></pre>
<p>With that, we have an infinite list  similar to the one we wrote in Haskell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">xs = make_list(1)
print(index_list(xs, 100)) # 101
</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-infinite-list-to-draw-fibonacci-numbers-from">An infinite list to draw Fibonacci numbers from</h2>
<p>We've established that infinite lists are really just regular values
that are left unevaluated thanks to Haskell's lazy nature.</p>
<p>By now, an infinite list that stores Fibonacci numbers should be easy to digest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">fibs :: [Int]
fibs = 1 : 2 : next fibs
  where
    next (x : xs) = (x + head xs) : next xs
    next _ = []
</code></pre>
<p>If this is still confusing, try working out the evaluation of <code>fibs !! 4</code> on paper.
You'll see that the <code>fibs</code> list is nearly identical to <code>xs</code>.</p>
<p>In the problem, we are asked to find out the sum of all even fibonacci numbers
that are less than 4000000. Try taking a stab at it before reading ahead.</p>
<p>You'll see that all we need to do now is translate the Python solution to Haskell.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep pulling items out of <code>fibs</code> until we hit a number larger than 4 million.
</li>
<li>Filter out all the odd numbers.
</li>
<li>Sum over the remaining numbers.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the full solution, around 12 lines of haskell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-hs">fibs :: [Int]
fibs = 1 : 2 : next fibs
  where
    next (x : xs) = (x + head xs) : next xs
    next _ = []

sumEvenFibsBelow :: Int -&gt; Int
sumEvenFibsBelow n = sum evenFibsBelowN
  where
    evenFibsBelowN = filter even fibsBelowN
    fibsBelowN = takeWhile (&lt; n) fibs

main :: IO ()
main = print $ sumEvenFibsBelow 4000000
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, fibonacci series is only a basic introduction to dynamic programming.
Other problems of similar nature can also be modelled on top of lazy lists.
As an exercise, you could try attempting
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/">this leetcode problem</a>
using memoization and infinite lists.</p>
