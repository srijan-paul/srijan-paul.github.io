<h3> Note </h3>
This review does not contain any spoilers outside the book&#39;s premise.
</div>
<p>After my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masako_Togawa">failed attempt</a> at cracking The Honjin Murders,
I hoped for better luck with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Key_(Togawa_novel)">The Master Key</a> – another Japanese murder mystery by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masako_Togawa">Masako Togawa</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-puzzle">The Puzzle</h2>
<p>The story revolves around the K apartment for ladies –
a housing complex inhabited by forlorn elderly women with seemingly boring lives.
The &quot;puzzle&quot; is a blood curdling secret lying under the building&#39;s concrete, soon to be revealed by a construction project.</p>
<p>Right from the opening, we&#39;re handed three mysteries –
a dead woman later discovered to be a male in disguise,
a missing child, and the secret underneath K apartments.
From here, the book completely shifts tones,
now chronicling the lives of women living in the apartment.
We get a glimpse into their motivations, everyday lives and youthful days.
And this goes on for about ~150 pages before the solution is revealed.</p>
<h2 id="my-review">My Review</h2>
<p>The writing stands out as strikingly different from your conventional murder mystery.
The bulk of the plot is about the characters involved, and the crime itself takes a back seat until <em>much</em> later.
Once the puzzle is presented, the narrative splits like a thread of yarn into parallel storylines.
Every apartment dweller&#39;s life is put under a magnifying glass,
purposefully leaving out their connection to the crime.
The mystery isn&#39;t the killer&#39;s identity, rather the missing links that would complete the story.</p>
<p>I felt that the English translation could&#39;ve used simpler language,
and some of the prose could&#39;ve been trimmed away.
The reveal struck me as odd too,
undermining many chance encounters and other key events by
unconvincingly presenting them as an elaborate plan by the antagonist.</p>
<details>
<summary>Minor spoiler</summary>
Towards the end, we learn that two distinct tenants were <em>the same person</em>.
And the reader is to believe that nobody suspected this for years.
</details>
<p>Do I recommend it? <br>
Depends.
I don&#39;t hold the puzzle in high regards, but the method of narration is unique,
making it worth a read if you like seeing how different authors approach the unfolding of a mystery in words.</p>
<p>If you couldn&#39;t tell already, I failed to guess the solution yet again.
Maybe I&#39;ll have better luck with my next read – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inugami_Curse">The Inugami Curse</a></p>
