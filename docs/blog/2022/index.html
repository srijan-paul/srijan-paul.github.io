    <p>This post is a paraphrasing of a journal entry with several details redacted.
And that fact is my excuse for shoddy writing and bad sentence/paragraph structure - it was not intended for public reading until 5 minutes ago.
Now that we’re clear on that, I can rant and rave about the past year to the sound of crickets.</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>2021 for me was exigent - demanding heavy attention and involvement in things that I definitely did not envision myself doing.</p>
<p>Three unfinished books, two unfinished projects and one pet death later - I still daresay this year could have been much worse.
I’ve been fortunate enough to not lose anyone to <em>you-know-what,</em> and have learned a fair amount of new (and unexpected) things, at the cost of sidelining things I actually planned to do.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I am ashamed to admit my rapid decline in reading books ever since I started attending college.
I’ve gone from 30 to 11 books a year in 2 years.
Regardless, here’s the favorite books I finished in 2021:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>: Fashionably late with this one.
It is an incredibly written book that I’m happy I read.
However, I wasn’t as impressed as I thought I would be, owing completely to over-expectation. <strong>8/10</strong>.
</li>
<li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>:
It’s a bit slow to start put picks up pace rather fast,
and teaches imperative minds that parentheses can be beautiful.
Cool algorithms, decent exercises, fun concepts and a good book. <strong>7/10.</strong>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a>: I’ve finished the first paperback
Herbert’s writing takes a little getting used to, and the story is slow to start off, but the concepts explored by this piece are intriguing.
I also love the author’s depiction of prescience, it’s largely non-cliché.
Currently, I’m reading it’s sequel - ‘Dune: Messiah’. <strong>7/10.</strong>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ipdatacorp.com/mmurtl/">MMURTL</a>: An okay-book for new OS developers.
I’m sure it was an amazing book in the year 2000, it just hasn’t aged that well.
It is likely that I rate this higher on a re-read once I’m more acquainted to OS internals.
For now though, 5/10.
</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OSTEP</a>: Could be a bit too beginner-y for some,
but it’s a near perfect introductory book to OS internals. <strong>9/10.</strong>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Writing-Wel-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548">On Writing Well</a>: Beautiful guide.
It’s reasonably short, but I feel it could have been shorter in some chapters.
Very straightforward and leaves the reader with a clear idea of mistakes to fix and skills to improve on.
<strong>9/10.</strong>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/archive/19fa/notes/120notes.pdf">PoPL (UPenn)</a>:
Originally written as lecture-notes for graduate students at University of Pensylvania, this is the easiest introduction to operational semantics and formal verification that I know of.
Props to the professors for making this available for free. <strong>10/10.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several other books and web-novels that I dropped halfway through, so I refuse to count them.
Hopefully by next year’s post I’ll have restored this habit.</p>
<h3 id="game-dev">Game-dev</h3>
<p>I managed to finish some jam entries, but that’s about it.
The biggest blocker here is my tendency to switch back and forth between game engines and frameworks.
I’m currently writing <a href="https://github.com/cpp-gamedev/wex">a game framework on top of SFML</a> that embeds vyse, insipired by LOVE’s simplicity and flexibility.</p>
<p>This year I want to learn more of computer graphics and stuff that goes on under the hood with GPUs and such.</p>
<h3 id="compilers">Compilers</h3>
<p>I thought I’d have made more progress with <a href="https://injuly.in/vyse/">Vyse</a>, but I had my hands full with loads of other work.
The <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene">Pallene</a> compiler saw a good amount of progress, which I’m happy about.
The language now supports lambdas and closures.
I see myself doing more work on both these projects in the future once I’ve more time to spare.
I wanted to make a compiled systems programming language,
but couldn’t find myself the liesure to act on the urge.</p>
<p>Learning mostly consisted of reading papers and conversations with people deep into PLs.
I managed to finish <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/archive/19fa/notes/120notes.pdf">PoPL</a> from UPenn and half of Types and Programming Languages by Pierce.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h3>
<p>I ended up having a brief stint with <em>cough</em> blockchain and NFT based projects - letting my morals take the backseat and favoring greed.</p>
<p>The people I worked with were smart, cooperative and capable.
It is just a difference in perspective that made me pull back.
I still keep an eye out for interesting chains, their contracts language, VMs and consensus methods,
but I do not see myself working in a field where a nugget of doubt in my own ethics is unavoidable.</p>
<p>To be honest, I see far less value in web3 than most people.
Blockchain is an interesting engineering approach, but a non-solution to most problems they’re actually hurled at.
I genuinely appreciate that this technology played a very important role in discussing the valuation of digital assets, just as we value real and tangible items.
If a majority of this role wasn’t edgy monkey JPEGs worth millions, I might still have been working in this field.
Also, I’m in the camp that prefers seeing ads over paying gas fees to tweet.</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>Apart from random <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> jam submissions, I played Nuclear Throne for the most part.
I’m not big into seasonal games anymore, but if I’m ever going to play any in the future, it will probably be Eastward.</p>
<h3 id="work-and-life">Work and Life</h3>
<p>I’m currently working at <a href="https://deepsource.io/">DeepSource</a> on static analyzers - and content with this choice.
There are however a number of unaccomplished goals will spill over to the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning the piano. I couldn’t manage my time efficiently enough to do this.
</li>
<li>Consistency with color theory and pixel art.
</li>
<li>Learning a new language (Chinese). I only learned bits and scraps of it towards the latter end of the year.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>
<p>More books, more piano, more type theory and more language.
Specific goals will begin to take shape once I start clearing my backlog.
On this blog however, you can continue to expect more math and functional programming.
Have a wonderful new year :)</p>
