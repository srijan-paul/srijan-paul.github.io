<h3> Note: </h3>
This is a spoiler-free review.

</div>
<p>On a lazy evening, I was strolling past an aisle of a local bookstore
when an intriguing book caught my attention.
I&#39;d gone with a friend who wanted to explore the city,
and had no intention of making a purchase myself,
but the crimson red cover drew me in.
The book was small too – at about 200 pages.
It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honjin_Murders">The Honjin Murders</a>:  the debut novel of Kosuke Kindaichi, Japan&#39;s Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>I thought it&#39;d make for a fun Honkaku mystery solving game, and picked it up.</p>
<h2 id="the-puzzle">The Puzzle</h2>
<p>The challenge is a classic locked room puzzle:
a couple is killed on the night of their wedding,
and there is no apparent way the killer could&#39;ve escaped.
Among other clues in the crime scene, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koto_(instrument)">Koto</a>
– a traditional Japanese music instrument – stained in blood with one of its strings plucked,
and a katana plunged into the snow.</p>
<p>The book revolves around the family of the bridegroom, the Koto,
a mysterious three-fingered man, and private investigator Kosuke.</p>
<h2 id="the-review">The Review</h2>
<p>While I didn&#39;t like the solution – more on that below – I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere,
and can recommend the book solely for that reason.
The author has skilfully crafted an eerie mood in surprisingly few pages [<a href="#backmatter">1</a>]</p>
<p>The book opens with a narrator who speaks to the reader in first person.
From start to finish, the tone is very consistent, and the narration doesn&#39;t falter once.
The writing flows smoothly between first-person dialogue addressing the reader, and third-person prose summarizing the accounts of villagers who witnessed the crime.
The harsh winters of post war Japan with several traditional Japanese elements splendidly sell the haunting atmosphere of K village – where the story takes place.</p>
<p>All of this is delivered under 200 pages.
I&#39;m impressed by writers who write without cruft.
What I&#39;m less impressed by, is the solution to the puzzle...</p>
<h2 id="did-i-solve-it">Did I solve it?</h2>
<p>Nope.
Not even close.
I didn&#39;t have the slightest clue to the killer&#39;s identity even
as I was a page away from the reveal.
I doubt <em>anyone</em> did.
The motivation and method of crime were equally bizarre.</p>
<p>I like to think of whodunnit mysteries as a game between the writer and their audience.
If I can guess who the killer is before its given away, I win.
Of course, the writer has an upper hand with their ability to twist the narration and hide obvious clues with red-herrings and other devices.
When abused beyond reason however, this leaves a sour taste,
like in my reading of the Honjin murders.</p>
<p>Some honkaku solutions are deceptively simple; while others are intricate, yet sensible.
This one was <em>maddening</em>.
The method of the crime was more obtuse than a Rube Goldberg machine – impossible to piece together with the clues handed to you throughout the book.
The killer&#39;s motivation was no better, hinging on a last minute reveal about mental illnesses that were only loosely alluded to in no more than two sentences throughout the book.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#39;t enough, early on in the book, the author explicitly mentions his distaste for cheap cop-outs in locked-room puzzles, only to use a strikingly similar one himself in the end.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I <em>still</em> deem this book to be a great piece of writing – barring the ending,
it nails <em>everything</em> else.
Perhaps, I&#39;d have felt differently if it dragged on for longer before the reveal.
But it didn&#39;t.
It was short.</p>
<p>Similarly short is my current attempt at solving a honkaku – <a href="/blog/the-master-key">The Master Key</a>.</p>
