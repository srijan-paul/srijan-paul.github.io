      <p>You are an Angelfish.
You're what all other fish in the tank wish they had been.
Fast, sleek and beautiful.
Tall and colorful dorsal fins flow in design as you cut through the waters.
Your sleek, aerodynamic body gliding with ease.
You’re as strong and dexterous as you're visually alluring.
The exotic and lustrous patterns on your scales complement your proverbial angelic nature.</p>
<p>When there is food to be had at the fishbowl's surface, you’re the first one to it.
Not because you can swim to the surface faster — you can, of course — but the other fish stay down until you’re done feeding.
They fear retribution.
For your sharp fangs can cut their fins down in a jiffy, should they claim a part in <em>your</em> meal.
So they wait in silence until you’re done, then squabble over the leftover slops you leave them.</p>
<p>You’re superior to everyone else in the bowl - towering above the guppies and goldfishes like some industrial skyscraper overshadowing a slum.</p>
<p>The humans are indifferent to this hierarchy.
You're the most majestic fish in the bowl.
That you reign supreme is only natural to those Darwinian creatures.
Your finesse is their pride.
And their pride, your self-assurance.</p>
<p>But are you happy at the top?</p>
<p>Some day, the fishbowl will be emptied into the ocean, each fish boarding a different current into the deep waters, never to meet another from the old group.
What of your superiority, then?
The deep seas are infested with scuttling eels, hunting piranhas, and enormous squids.
A shark will devour you and the guppies alike, oblivious to your dominance over them.
A whirlpool will drag you to its center — just as it would drag a goldfish — without regard for your upper hand in size.
You’re still better than your peers, but the vast expanse of the ocean dwarfs you.</p>
<p>The terror of losing it all keeps you awake at night.
To those other fish, it makes no difference.
They’ve always been bottom-feeders.
They will continue to be bottom-feeders.
You, however, will cease to be at the top.
The ocean scorns your pride, threatening to fling you down to the lower strata of marine life, stripping you of your honor.
You realize now that your dignity anchored itself on fishes far beneath you.
In a way, you <em>depended</em> on them.
Fear of loss grips your chest tight, nerves stretching thin.
Bereft of hope, where will you go?</p>
<p>As far as you are above the other fish, the ocean is even farther above you.</p>
