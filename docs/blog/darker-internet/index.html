      <p>How often do you append &quot;reddit&quot; or &quot;wiki&quot; to your Google search queries? <br>
Why seek out human discourse on specific websites,
when search engines were invented to do it for you?</p>
<p>If you asked Google for workout routines a decade ago, you would find workout routines.
If you ask Google for a workout routines today, you&#39;ll find: paid search results, ads, third party cookies, trackers, newsletter prompts, notification access requests, more ads, and, if you&#39;re lucky – a workout routine<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup>.

<p>This is in stark contrast with the old internet – a small web where sites run by individuals were easier to find, and communities developed organically across multiple forums.
Gothic mods and Starcraft fanfics weren&#39;t subreddits; and personal websites didn&#39;t live on substack or medium.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the race to commoditize our attention, everything has moved to select few apps:

<p>This is by design, Of course. A search engine cannot make money by nimbly leading you to webpages free of charge. The real money is in <em>hiding</em>  pages. Showing only the results from firms that can pay to retain their position in the results page – either by paying Google directly, or by hosting ads that share revenue with Google.</p>

<p>That is not to say blogs on substack or medium are inferior. Some of my favourite blogs are on substack. Only that reading everyone&#39;s blogs on the same few platforms doesn&#39;t feel as diverse.</p>
