As of today, [my NES emulator](https://github.com/srijan-paul/nez/) is fully functional!
Well, except audio â€“ I still haven't started on the [APU](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/APU).
It can run all [NROM games](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper0.html), and I plan on adding at least two more mappers before the month is out.

On the side, I've also begun a rewrite of my [SSG](https://github.com/srijan-paul/bark).
It will still be small, but have *just* enough build-time features so that I can avoid bundling JavaScript with this website.
