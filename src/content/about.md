## Me

I'm Srijan, A CS and Math enthusiast currently in Bangalore, India.
As of January 2023, I'm reading [Words of Radiance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance), and learning [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology).
You can find out more in the section titled [current](/current).

For upkeep, I do language engineering at [DeepSource](https://deepsource.com) - a code health analysis tool.

## This site

This website has been made with <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/bark" target="_blank">bark</a> -
a bespoke static site generator written in Haskell by yours truly.
It's intended for personal use only, but can easily be adapted for websites similar to mine.
