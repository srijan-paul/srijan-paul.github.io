## Jan. 2023

It's been 10 months since my last update.
I plan on pushing these out more often, starting with this one.
Perhaps an active log will help me find out just where all my free time runs off to.

### Reading

I'm done with [The Way of Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings),
and now consider it peak high fantasy.
It is a perfect blend of excellent prose, compelling storytelling and masterful worldbuilding.
I could go on, but I'd rather have you find out yourself.

In summary, I read these books over the past 10 months:

- [The Way of Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings)
- [Warbreaker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker)
- [The three body problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem)
- [Dark Forest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest)
- [Death's End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451264-death-s-end)
- [Exhalation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation)
- [Free will](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13259270-free-will)

Books I'm currently reading:

- [Words of Radiance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance): Stormlight Archive #2, sequel to The Way of Kings.
- [Immortals of Meluha](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7913305):
  I'm reading the audiobook on-and-off during bus rides, meals and walks.
- [Linear Algebra and it's applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179699.Linear_Algebra_and_Its_Applications):
  I've taken HS and college courses on this subject already, but this book is an excellent refresher.

Books I plan to read:

- [The Name of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind) (Kingkiller chronicle #1)
- [Hold up the sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247266-to-hold-up-the-sky)
- [Thinking with types](https://thinkingwithtypes.com/)

### Projects

Unlike the last few updates, I have nothing noteworthy this time. 
I've been doing touch-ups to [Vyse](injuly.in/vyse), hand-coding [neural networks](https://github.com/srijan-paul/neural-prob-estimation)
from scratch, and making [fourier sketches](injuly.in/blog/fourier-series).

Soon, I'm going to implement the Neural Language Model described in [Yoshua Bengio's paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) from 2003.

My sojourn at the manifold of NNs and statistical models will probably last for a while.
In the meantime, I'm on the lookout for other things to build as well.

### Plans

Write more often.
This time for real.
