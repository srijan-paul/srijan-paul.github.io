## Jan. 2022
I'm CS undergraduate, and a software engineer by profession.
Non-professional interests are game development, pixel art and fiction.
As of January 2021, these are my going ons :^)

### Reading
Current readings are [Dune - Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah) and [Hercule Poirot's Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot%27s_Christmas).
I plan on finishing the dune saga in the first half of this year, before I begin Mistborn.

I also wish to read  [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian) and [Category theory for programmers](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/33618151-category-theory-for-programmers) in the very near future. The former might be on my desk before the end of this month.

### Projects
Currently building my static site generator - [Bark](https://injuly.in/bark/).
This month I plan on updating the frontmatter parser to a monadic one, adding directory watching and serving files on localhost.

Two of my older projects have been dormant for a while - [Vyse](https://injuly.in/vyse) and [Wex](https://github.com/cpp-gamedev/wex).
It's about time I revive them as well.
For Vyse, I plan to add support for custom objects and module loading.
A clearer roadmap for wex is yet to come.
