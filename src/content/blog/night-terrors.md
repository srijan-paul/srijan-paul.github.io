Back when I was 5 or so years old, my family used to live in a remote suburban area.
Naturally, power-cuts were common and recurred on a daily basis.
During outages in hot summer nights, the ceiling fan in our bedroom would grind to a halt and I'd start complaining about the unpleasant darkness and heat right after.
My mother would always wave a paper hand-fan near my face to put me to sleep.
The outdoors were dimly lit owing to the faint moonlight, and I could fall asleep soon enough on most days.

Some nights however, clouds would cover the moon and my surroundings would become pitch dark. Unbearably dark.

I used to let out a deafening, high pitched scream as soon as the feeble moonlight dim faded into complete darkness.
My parents would naturally get worried.
One of them would scurry around the house looking for matchsticks and candles while the other comforted me as I cried.
Soon enough, light from the candles put me at ease while I recovered from my panic with a tight chest and heavy breathing.
This would happen somewhat infrequently back then, and I hadn't grown enough to figure out what it really was.
Can't say I have even now, but I understand it better than I did at the time.

Fast forward several years, I'm in high school and it's the night before an exam.
I was reading this short manga by Junji Ito titled '[The Enigma of Amiagara Fault](https://junjiitomanga.fandom.com/wiki/The_Enigma_of_Amigara_Fault)'.
This piece explores themes of compulsion, mystery, death drive and one of my worst fears that I wasn't aware of at the time - claustrophobia.
A common aftereffect this manga has had on many is the inability to sleep the night after reading.
For me, this condition lasted for about **a week**.

The nights that followed this little read were the most unpleasant.
Every time I closed my eyes to sleep, the thought of being trapped in a dark, unventilated coffin-like space struck me.
My chest tightened and acute restlessness took over my entire upper body.
No matter how deep the breaths I took, my mind had convinced itself that it's deprived of oxygen.
It was like drowning while being aware that there is no way I could possibly hold my breath for long enough to make it to the surface.
I jumped out of my bed in panic and reached for the light switch, slamming my palm on the switchboard, switching a bunch of them together.
Once the room was lit and my eyes **saw** that I was, in fact, not in a dark tiny torture chamber, my anxiety receded.

With time, the memory of having read this manga faded away.
I would only faintly recall this feeling when I saw Ito's name mentioned somewhere online, or when the anime adaptation of his works was announced.
I had moved on, and the claustrophobic anxiety attacks became a distant thing of the past.
It would continue to be this way until the monsoon of 2021.

I now live in a costal town which happens to be very prone to hurricanes and cyclones.
There is one at least every year.
For the unlucky, it washes their houses away, for us, it just means we have to live without electricity for a day or so once our inverter runs out.
This time, just like every other, a decently severe cyclone had hit us again and the well-to-do part of the population was fairly nonchalant because of being used to it.
It was predicted to make landfall in the evening, meaning the inverter would run out around midnight and the authorities would start fixing the power lines the next morning.

By nightfall, the cyclone had dwindled, leaving behind a mild storm.
Though inside the house it was dark and surprisingly quiet, probably because of how tightly we had barricaded the windows.
My phone's screen was the only source of light in my entire room.
Mother had stocked candles and matchsticks, but forgot them in a shed couple meters down from our house.
Neither of us were willing to go out in the rain and get them, so we mutually made-believe that the night wouldn't call for any emergencies.
In hindsight... we should have known better.

Come midnight, my phone was at 9% battery and it was much, much darker than I had anticipated.
The best way to define it is simply 'black'.
When looking away from my phone, I couldn't tell any difference in what I was seeing when my eyes were open or shut.
Once again, I was slowly starting to panic.
I felt it in me, there was some irksome experience looming onto me, waiting for the phone to die.
I took slow and deep breaths and kept scrolling through discord in bed, still unsure of what it would be like once the phone croaked. So when it finally did, I went through hell.

It was **unbearable**, I couldn't breathe and kept kicking around in terror.
I fanned my limbs out wide, trying to feel the empty space around me to convince my brain that I was in an open area with lots of space to breathe in.
It didn't work, nothing did.
I tried holding down the power button on my phone, the manufacturer logo came up for a few seconds, dimly lighting up the space and giving me a small breathing room, then it shut down right after.
My chest started aching from the repeated rapid contractions and my throat became dry and sore.
It was horrible, but even worse was knowing that there was no way out, knowing there was no other light source anywhere close to me and this anxiety attack **was to continue** until I calmed myself down.
Luckily, mother heard noises from my sudden hysteria and turned on her phone's flash to see what I was upto.
I took her phone, told her I couldn't sleep when it's this dark and continued to scroll through random Wikipedia articles about old Chinese movies.

One dawn broke, I became aware of two things that knew could panic attacks for me:

- Claustrophobic spaces.
- Complete darkness.

Luckily, I am not a war prisoner sentenced to solitary confinement, so neither of these situations are common.
I do know however that if I was ever to be trapped in a confined space for whatever reason, like if I was in a collapsed building from an earthquake, I'd kick the bucket in no time.

However, In the past month or two, I have been having these episodic night terrors again, despite being in dimly lit, spacious rooms when in bed.
I suspect it has to do with things not going too well in life for me, so I might finally see a medical professional about this.

If there is anything to be happy about, maybe it's that I am phobic to darkness and closed spaces, and not balloons (globophobia), books (bibliophobia), sleep (somniphobia) or workplaces (ergophobia).
Guess I'm a glass-half-full person ;)
