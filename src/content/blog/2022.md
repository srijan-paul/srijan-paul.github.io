This post is a paraphrasing of a journal entry with several details redacted.
And that fact is my excuse for shoddy writing and bad sentence/paragraph structure - it was not intended for public reading until 5 minutes ago.
Now that we’re clear on that, I can rant and rave about the past year to the sound of crickets.

## 2021

2021 for me was exigent - demanding heavy attention and involvement in things that I definitely did not envision myself doing.

Three unfinished books, two unfinished projects and one pet death later - I still daresay this year could have been much worse.
I’ve been fortunate enough to not lose anyone to *you-know-what,* and have learned a fair amount of new (and unexpected) things, at the cost of sidelining things I actually planned to do.

### Reading

I am ashamed to admit my rapid decline in reading books ever since I started attending college.
I’ve gone from 30 to 11 books a year in 2 years.
Regardless, here’s the favorite books I finished in 2021:

1. [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four): Fashionably late with this one.
   It is an incredibly written book that I’m happy I read.
   However, I wasn’t as impressed as I thought I would be, owing completely to over-expectation. **8/10**.
2. [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html):
   It’s a bit slow to start put picks up pace rather fast,
   and teaches imperative minds that parentheses can be beautiful.
   Cool algorithms, decent exercises, fun concepts and a good book. **7/10.**
3. [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)): I’ve finished the first paperback
   Herbert’s writing takes a little getting used to, and the story is slow to start off, but the concepts explored by this piece are intriguing.
   I also love the author’s depiction of prescience, it’s largely non-cliché.
   Currently, I’m reading it’s sequel - ‘Dune: Messiah’. **7/10.**
4. [MMURTL](http://www.ipdatacorp.com/mmurtl/): An okay-book for new OS developers.
   I’m sure it was an amazing book in the year 2000, it just hasn’t aged that well.
   It is likely that I rate this higher on a re-read once I’m more acquainted to OS internals.
   For now though, 5/10.
5. [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/): Could be a bit too beginner-y for some,
   but it’s a near perfect introductory book to OS internals. **9/10.**
6. [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.in/Writing-Wel-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548): Beautiful guide.
   It’s reasonably short, but I feel it could have been shorter in some chapters.
   Very straightforward and leaves the reader with a clear idea of mistakes to fix and skills to improve on.
   **9/10.**
7. [PoPL (UPenn)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/archive/19fa/notes/120notes.pdf):
   Originally written as lecture-notes for graduate students at University of Pensylvania, this is the easiest introduction to operational semantics and formal verification that I know of.
   Props to the professors for making this available for free. **10/10.**

There are several other books and web-novels that I dropped halfway through, so I refuse to count them.
Hopefully by next year’s post I’ll have restored this habit.

### Game-dev

I managed to finish some jam entries, but that’s about it.
The biggest blocker here is my tendency to switch back and forth between game engines and frameworks.
I’m currently writing [a game framework on top of SFML](https://github.com/cpp-gamedev/wex) that embeds vyse, insipired by LOVE’s simplicity and flexibility.

This year I want to learn more of computer graphics and stuff that goes on under the hood with GPUs and such.

### Compilers

I thought I’d have made more progress with [Vyse](https://injuly.in/vyse/), but I had my hands full with loads of other work.
The [Pallene](https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene) compiler saw a good amount of progress, which I’m happy about.
The language now supports lambdas and closures.
I see myself doing more work on both these projects in the future once I’ve more time to spare.
I wanted to make a compiled systems programming language,
but couldn’t find myself the liesure to act on the urge.

Learning mostly consisted of reading papers and conversations with people deep into PLs.
I managed to finish [PoPL](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/archive/19fa/notes/120notes.pdf) from UPenn and half of Types and Programming Languages by Pierce.

### Blockchain

I ended up having a brief stint with *cough* blockchain and NFT based projects - letting my morals take the backseat and favoring greed.

The people I worked with were smart, cooperative and capable.
It is just a difference in perspective that made me pull back.
I still keep an eye out for interesting chains, their contracts language, VMs and consensus methods,
but I do not see myself working in a field where a nugget of doubt in my own ethics is unavoidable.

To be honest, I see far less value in web3 than most people.
Blockchain is an interesting engineering approach, but a non-solution to most problems they’re actually hurled at.
I genuinely appreciate that this technology played a very important role in discussing the valuation of digital assets, just as we value real and tangible items.
If a majority of this role wasn’t edgy monkey JPEGs worth millions, I might still have been working in this field.
Also, I’m in the camp that prefers seeing ads over paying gas fees to tweet.

### Games

Apart from random [itch.io](http://itch.io) jam submissions, I played Nuclear Throne for the most part.
I’m not big into seasonal games anymore, but if I’m ever going to play any in the future, it will probably be Eastward.

### Work and Life

I’m currently working at [DeepSource](https://deepsource.io/) on static analyzers - and content with this choice.
There are however a number of unaccomplished goals will spill over to the next year:

- Learning the piano. I couldn’t manage my time efficiently enough to do this.
- Consistency with color theory and pixel art.
- Learning a new language (Chinese). I only learned bits and scraps of it towards the latter end of the year.

## 2022

More books, more piano, more type theory and more language.
Specific goals will begin to take shape once I start clearing my backlog.
On this blog however, you can continue to expect more math and functional programming.
Have a wonderful new year :)
