There have been more
pointless startups in the past decade than any other time in human history.

<!-- TODO: this part -->

Back when the crypto rabble was only beginning to head down
to the bottom of its death pit, a close friend mine had joined a blockchain startup.

I'd spoken with the company's interview panel,
and their director made some points that seemed too good to be true.
For instance:
    1. Zero gas fees on every transaction.
    2. Instant transactions faster than today's banking apps.
    3. Account recovery for users, _even when they'd forgotten their recovery phrases_.

Of course, I'd several questions.
If a transaction has no gas fee, why would a miner validate its checksum?
There is no incentive for a GPU hoarder to mine their crypto over, say, 

I've yet to see a blockchain product with real merit ([1](TODO)).
Most _D_applications are convuluted ways of solving problems that either do not exist,
or exist solely because of other blockchain products.
