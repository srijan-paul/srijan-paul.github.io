I'm Srijan â€“ a programmer, hobbyist game-dev, and math enthusiast.
On this website I document my projects, interests, and research endeavours.

Currently, I work at <a href="https://deepsource.com/" target="_blank">DeepSource</a>.

My other interests include pixel art and reading (sometimes writing) fiction.
