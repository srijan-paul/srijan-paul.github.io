A CS undergrad who is into functional programming, PL theory,
distributed systems and game dev.
I also go by **injuly** around the web and write software in Haskell/Typescript/C++.
I ocassionaly help develop Lua's compiled sister language - <a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene" target="_blank">Pallene</a>.

Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at <a href="https://deepsource.io/" target="_blank">DeepSource</a>.

Some of my other interests include pixel art, reading and occasionally writing fiction.
You might find some amateur pixel art on <a href="https://twitter.com/_injuly" target="_blank">my twitter</a>.
