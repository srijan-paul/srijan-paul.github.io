I also go by **injuly** around the web.
My programming languages of choice are Haskell, Typescript and C++.
Occassionally, I help the folks over at <a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/" target="_blank">LabLua</a> develop
<a href="https://github.com/pallene-lang/pallene" target="_blank"> Pallene</a> - Lua's sister language.

Currently, I work at <a href="https://deepsource.io/" target="_blank">DeepSource</a>.

My other interests include math, pixel art, reading (and occassionaly writing) fiction.
You may find some amateur pixel art on <a href="https://twitter.com/_injuly" target="_blank">my twitter</a>.
