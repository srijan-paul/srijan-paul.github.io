## 27th Feb, 2024

I was unable to tend to my [NES emulator](https://github.com/srijan-paul/nez) this month.<br>
My [static site generator](https://github.com/srijan-paul/bark), however, has seen a complete re-write. <br>
In the coming week, I plan to release it as a hackage library, and move some more features of this site from runtime JavaScript to build-time Haskell.

## Reading

I was reading some Japanese murder mysteries this month.
