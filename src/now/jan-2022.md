## Jan. 2022
Whiling away my 5th semester in home isolation with a laptop and a couple of books.
As of January 2021, these are my going ons :^)

### Reading
My current readings are [Dune - Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah) and [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian).
I plan on finishing the dune saga in the first half of this year, before I begin some of Sanderson's books.

I also wish to read  [Thinking with Types](https://thinkingwithtypes.com/) and
[Category theory for programmers](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/33618151-category-theory-for-programmers)
in the very near future.
The former might be on my desk before the end of this month.

### Projects
I am currently building my static site generator - [Bark](https://injuly.in/bark/). <br/>
I've recently ported this website to the said SSG, and have added support for tags.
This month I plan on updating the frontmatter parser to a monadic one, implementing directory watching and the ability to serve files on localhost.

Two of my older projects have been dormant for a while -
[Vyse](https://injuly.in/vyse) and [Wex](https://github.com/cpp-gamedev/wex). <br/>
It's about time I revive them.
For Vyse, I plan to add support for userdata objects and module loading.
A clearer roadmap for wex is yet to come.

### Plans 
This year I plan on doing more game jams on itch, learning more Russian,
playing the Piano and writing at least once every month on the blog.
