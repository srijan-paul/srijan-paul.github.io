## Feb 2023

This month, I was busy setting base in Bangalore.
Moving is a lot of work, and I am still adjusting to the city - loads of people,
incessant honking on roads, metros operating at twice their capacity, and a language unknown to me.

I'm sure there's a lot more that will be to my liking, and I'm just taking my time synchronising.
The whole moving-and-packing dance, however, has disrupted my usual schedule
(which wasn't something to be proud of in the first place).
I'm a little behind on some personal projects, and there's no library here like there was back in college,
but my trajectory will fix itself.

### Reading

Still on Words of Radiance, and I picked [Real world haskell](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/) back up.

My to-read list looks almost the same as last time:

- [Docker deep dive](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36411996)
- [The Name of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind) (Kingkiller chronicle #1)
- [The Blade Itself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944073.The_Blade_Itself)
- [Thinking with types](https://thinkingwithtypes.com/)

### Projects

In a span of about 2 days, I made something cool - a Brainfuck interpreter, written entirely in TypeScript's type-system.
The code can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/srijan-paul/tsfun/blob/main/src/index.ts).
I also spoke about it in a talk about type-level programming and turing complete type systems.
[TODO@self: add a link here once it's uploaded to YouTube].

Last time, I said I'll be writing an Neural Language Model.
Well, I changed my mind.

Lately, I've been looking into the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)'s architecture.
I want to write an emulator for it, but my current understanding of its hardware (and 6502 assembly) is far from adequate.

Everyday, after coming home from work, I've been making notes, and reading the [NESDev wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki).
Perhaps I'll have something to show in my next log?

### Plans

- Research the NES's hardware, and the 6502 assembly language.
- Organize some papers and further reading for LLMs in my private notion, for later use. 
Look into some keyboards to replace my current one.
