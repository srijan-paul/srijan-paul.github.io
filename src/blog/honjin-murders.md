I was strolling past an aisle of a local bookstore on a lazy evening
when an intriguing book caught my attention.
I had gone with a friend who wanted to explore the city, with no intent of making a purchase.
But the cover art was beautiful, and the book small - fewer than 200 pages.

I thought it'd make for a fun Honkaku mystery solving game and picked it up.
