## Me

I'm Srijan, A CS and Math enthusiast currently in Bangalore, India.
As of January 2024, I'm reading [Age of Myth](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34002132), and studying category theory. 
You can find out more in the section titled [now](/now).

For upkeep, I do language engineering at [DeepSource](https://deepsource.com) - a code health tool.
