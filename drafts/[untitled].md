"Inaction begets inaction.
Cowering away from a hard choice is an act of compounding indecisiveness with stagnation.
An act that smothers progress."
This axiom every member of the medic's guild knew.

Hunched on a hut's windowsill, Eliad felt a violent surge of emotions weigh his chest down.
The guild's people was all he had.
They had made him the man he was.
Leaving them behind meant letting go of everything that gave him a sense of selfdom.
It meant letting go of a life of certainity and safety,
taking a road that leads to places he'd never been.

Yet every cell of his being cried for change.
He was deeply dissatisfied with his position in the guild... in life.
He sought to climb out of stagnation, and into a new self.

Inability to choose between certain stagnation and uncertain future
-- this was the crux of his turmoil.
But life demanded decisions of him.
He silently mouthed the axiom to himself,
drew in a deep breath to suppress the churning in his chest and stood upright,
hands still on the windowsill.

He had decided.
In the next guild gathering, he would announce his departure from the field of medicine.
He would venture out of this land and live the experiences this universe had to offer.
