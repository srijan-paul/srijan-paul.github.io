# Perils of prescience.

Prescience - the ability to peer into the future - is a sufficiently explored superpower in fiction.
Different characters possess this power in varying degrees -
fortelling the next couple of seconds,
knowing how far away someone is from death,
getting glimpses of a distant future in a dream,
or knowing every second of their own life in vivid detail.

It sounds like the coolest power to have,
guiding every decision you take, ensuring you ace every test,
win every gamble, impress every stranger.
